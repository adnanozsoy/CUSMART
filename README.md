# CUSMART
CUSMART is a collection of exact string matching algorithms implemented in CUDA C/C++. This project is inspired by another great project called SMART by Simone Faro and Thierry Lecroq and includes it for the CPU benchmarks.

Our aim is to improve the performance of notable string matching algorithms by leveraging GPGPU architecture features and create a toolkit to test, design, evaluate and understand the existing solutions for the exact string matching problem.

The project is still under active development.

## How to compile it from source?
There are build scripts under scripts folder for Linux and Windows platforms. You need Cmake v3.9 or later to compile the project.
